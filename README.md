# Challenge-1

## Description

This week's challenge was to format the Horiseon website's HTML code into a more cohesive and accessible structure. 

By following HTML semantics and applying independent styling and positioning to the code it is much easier to read and edit if need be.

Section, nav, and aside elements were used to replace some div tags in order to make it look cleaner.

There was nav element added to help with SEO, along with adding descriptive alt text to the images in order to make it more accessible to different users who perhaps use screen readers, and help SEO.
